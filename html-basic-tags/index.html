            This structure is a comment block in html files
            everything in this structure is NOT considered part of any
                content of your web page

            Most tag elements in html are done in pairs
            These are called opening and closing pairs
            There are some tags that are not in pairs and are referred to 
                as empty tags (a.k.a. void)
            The opening tag indicates the start of your element
                and the closing tag indicates the end of your elements
            The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS
                a slash (/) preceeding the name

            The head area of your web page is NOT considered content
            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to
                manage some display of the page, give additional documentaion
                to the page, indicate charactersets, help with search engines
                and many other assists.

        <h3>Paragragh Tag</h3>
        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragragh
            The paragragh tag belongs to the 'block' group of tags
            A 'block' group tag places your content on a new line

            You can place all your paragragh text content on one physical line, 
                however that would require a lot of scrolling right and left
            You can have word wrap actice in your editor and it will NOT affect 
                how the browser displays your paragragh content. You can place your 
                content on seperate lines yourself and it will not affect how the browser
                displays your paragragh content.
        -->
        <p>The paragragh tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when the 
            content is displayed by your browser. The broswer does NOT display your content in the physical
            style of how you have entered your code in html file.
        </p>
        <p>This is a second paragragh on the broswer page. It will start a new line
        </p>
        <!-- 
            If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag) 
                you would be in trouble using the tag
            instead: you can use special character strings to represent components 
                of the tag such as < (&lt;) and the > (&gt;) symbols
        -->
        <h3>List tags: &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;</h3>

                create an unordered list (bulleted) using <ul>
                items in the list are indicated using the line item <li>
                lists can be nested and mixed
